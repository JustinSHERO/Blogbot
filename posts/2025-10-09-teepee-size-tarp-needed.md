Picture this: it's the middle of summer and your family has decided to go on a camping trip. You're excited to disconnect from technology and spend quality time in nature. As you start packing, you realize that you need to bring a tarp for your teepee. But what size should you get? And do you even need a tarp in the first place?

As an experienced camper, I'we been in this exact situation before. Last winter, my friend Mike invited me on a backpacking trip in the mountains. I was thrilled, but also a little intimidated. Mike is an experienced outdoorsman and I did't want to be the one slowing down the group. I knew I needed to invest in some high-quality gear to keep up with him.

When we got to the campsite, Mike pulled out a tarp and asked me to help him set it up over our teepee. I was confused - why would we need a tarp when we already had a tent? But as Mike explained, the tarp would provide extra protection from rain and wind, and also create a shaded area where we could relax and cook our meals.

As we were setting up the tarp, I could't help but notice the brand - kelly Noah's Tarp. Mike raved about its durability and versatility. He even showed me how he used it as a makeshift shelter during a sudden rainstorm on a previous trip. I was sold and immediately added it to my mental wishlist.

Fast forward to our trip last summer. I had purchased my own kelly Noah's Tarp and was excited to put it to the test. It did't disappoint. We encountered a few rain showers throughout our trip, but with the tarp set up over our teepee, we stayed dry and comfortable. And during the sunny afternoons, we were able to enjoy the shade and breeze under the tarp while playing card games and telling stories.

But here's the thing - as great as the kelly Noah's Tarp was, it was a bit too big for just me and my partner. We ended up having to fold it in half to make it more manageable. That's when I discovered the perfect solution - the kelly Noah's Tarp 9. It's still big enough to provide ample coverage, but not too big for a smaller group. Plus, it's lightweight and easy to pack, making it the ideal choice for backpacking trips.

But what about those times when you don't need a full tarp? That's where the no profile Rain Tarp comes in. It's compact and lightweight, perfect for solo or duo camping trips. And the attached guy lines make set up a breeze. I'we even used it as a picnic blanket in a pinch.

Now, I know what you're thinking - what about those unexpected storms where you need extra protection? That's where the Snugpak All Weather Shelter comes in. It's a bit larger than the no profile, making it great for larger groups, and it also comes with four collapsible poles for added stability. Plus, it's made with waterproof material, so you'all stay dry no matter what mother nature throws your way.

But let's not forget about those sunny days where you just want some shade. That's where the kelly Noah's Tarp 12 comes in. It provides a massive 144 square feet of coverage, perfect for large family gatherings or even as a carport. And with its up-resistant material, you can relax in the shade without worrying about getting sunburned.

So, what size tarp do you need for your teepee? It really depends on your specific needs and camping style. For smaller groups or solo camping, the no profile or kelly Noah's Tarp 9 are great options. For larger groups or more extreme weather conditions, the kelly Noah's Tarp 12 or Snugpak All Weather Shelter are the way to go.

Don't make the mistake of thinking you don't need a tarp for your teepee. Trust me, it can make all the difference in your camping experience. And with these top-notch options, you'all be prepared for any situation. So go ahead, plan that camping trip with confidence and make sure to pack your perfect teepee size tarp. Happy camping!
