<p>Imagine you're gearing up for a spontaneous weekend getaway in the mountains. The forecast promises crisp, cool nights, just dipping below 45 degrees—a perfect escape from the city heat. But there's one hitch: your old, bulky sleeping bag is begging for retirement. It's too heavy, too cumbersome for your light trek. You've eyed those ultra-compact sleeping bags on Amazon, wondering if they can really keep you warm and snug without the bulk. Could a lightweight, affordable model truly stand up to the chill of a mountain night?</p>
<p>Here's what changed everything for me. After countless nights under the stars and more than a few chilly mornings, I've put together a list of the top 10 ultra-compact sleeping bags that not only saved my back and space but also kept me wonderfully warm down to 45 degrees—all within a budget of $100 to $200.</p>
